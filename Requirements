# Files assignment
The assignment simulates the order taking process at a diner. The menu items (found in data.py)
has item types, item description, and price. 
Create a functions.py module that will have code for the following functions. 
a. Save the menu_items data to a .csv file.  This function will receive the list, and file_name as inputs.
d. Create a function named make_order that will build an order using order taker name (input by the user), list of three items 
(randomly selected from the list), corresponding quantities (randomly generated from a [3, 10] range, 
and the delivery option (either dine-in or to-go). The function will use the list as an argument and return the order.
e. Print the order details, and compute the total
